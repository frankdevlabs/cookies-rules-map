Iceland has implemented the ePrivacy Directive in conjunction with the GDPR through its national legislation. Enforced by the **Icelandic Data Protection Authority (Persónuvernd)**, this framework requires user consent for the use of analytical cookies and emphasizes transparency and active consent. Strictly necessary cookies used for services explicitly requested by the user, however, are exempt from the consent requirement.

### Key Provisions:

- **Consent for Analytical Cookies**: Consent is mandatory for cookies used to analyze user behavior, ensuring users are fully informed before their data is processed.
- **Transparency and Active User Consent**: Users must be provided with clear information about the purpose and use of cookies, with consent needing to be explicit, not implied.
- **Exemption for Strictly Necessary Cookies**: Cookies essential for providing services requested by the user can be employed without obtaining prior consent.

### Guidelines for Consent:

The Icelandic guidelines emphasize the following for valid consent:

- **Informed Users**: Individuals should receive comprehensive information about cookie purposes.
- **Freely Given Consent**: Consent must be an explicit action by the user, such as clicking an 'I agree' button, without interpretations from mere scrolling or passive acceptance.
- **Specific and Easily Revocable**: Users must be able to withdraw their consent as easily as they gave it, ensuring ongoing control over their data.

## Exemptions

Under Iceland's approach, specific exemptions apply to the consent requirement for certain types of cookies:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: These cookies are essential for the operation of a website and services requested by the user, such as those providing security or session management.

These provisions outline how certain cookies can be employed without explicit consent due to their necessity for basic functionality or user-requested services, while maintaining the overarching principle of user privacy.
