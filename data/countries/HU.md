Hungary has implemented its approach to cookie consent through the **Act C of 2003 on Electronic Communications**. This legislative framework emphasizes the need for obtaining user consent for non-essential cookies, including analytical cookies, which are not covered under strictly necessary exemptions. The **Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH)** oversees compliance with these regulations. The law stresses the importance of informed user consent for cookie usage, typically facilitated by cookie banners and other consent mechanisms.

## Hungarian Legislation on Cookies
Under the Hungarian legal framework, consent must be obtained for all non-essential cookies. This means:
- **Analytical Cookies**: Require consent, as they are recognized as non-essential.
- **Consent Mechanisms**: Users should be informed adequately, often through methods like cookie banners.
- **NAIH Guidance**: Provides detailed instructions and best practices for compliance.

## Consent Requirements
The requirements for cookie consent in Hungary include:
- **Informed Consent**: Users must understand the purpose and use of cookies before consenting.
- **Active Interaction**: Consent cannot be presumed; it must be a result of a clear action taken by the user.
- **Revocable**: Users should be able to withdraw their consent as easily as it was given.

## Exemptions
The Hungarian approach dictates that strictly necessary cookies, which support core functionality and are indispensable for user-requested services, can be exempted from the consent requirement.

## Authority and Guidance
The Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH) offers guidance and support, ensuring that entities adhere to the proper mechanisms for gaining and managing user consent regarding cookies.
