Austria has implemented cookie regulations in line with the ePrivacy Directive through its **Telecommunications Act 2021 (TKG 2021)** and **Data Protection Act (DSG)**. The legislation mandates prior consent for the use of non-essential cookies, including those used for analytics, unless these cookies are fully anonymized and aggregated. Essential cookies that are crucial for the functioning of the website are exempt from this consent requirement. The **Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB)** is responsible for enforcement, ensuring compliance with these regulations.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement

In Austria, the approach to obtaining consent for cookies is detailed by the legislation. The key points are:

- **Prior Consent**: Users must provide consent for non-essential cookies before these cookies are deployed. This includes cookies for analytics that are not anonymized or aggregated.
- **Essential Cookies Exemption**: Consent is not required for cookies that are necessary for the website to function properly.

The legislation emphasizes user control over data privacy, requiring transparency and explicit consent for any tracking activity that is not essential.

## Exemptions

Certain types of cookies do not require user consent under the Austrian regulations:

- **Essential Cookies**: These cookies are necessary for the basic functionality of the website, such as maintaining session states for users or implementing security-related features.
- **Anonymized Analytics Cookies**: If analytics cookies are fully anonymized and aggregated, they may be exempt from consent requirements. This exemption aligns with ensuring minimal impact on user data privacy while still allowing for certain performance assessments.
