Denmark has implemented its cookie legislation through a series of laws, including the **Danish Executive Order on Cookies**, the **Danish Marketing Practices Act**, and the **Danish Data Protection Act**. These laws align with the requirements of the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR, and are enforced by the **Danish Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet)**. The legal framework establishes requirements for obtaining informed consent for the use of non-essential cookies and similar tracking technologies.

## Informed Consent Requirement
In Denmark, informed consent is required for the use of non-essential cookies, except for cases meeting specific exemptions. The consent must satisfy the following criteria:
- **Informed**: Users must be provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purpose of data collection and use.
- **Freely Given**: Consent must represent a genuine choice and be obtained prior to any data collection.
- **Specific and Unambiguous**: Clear affirmative action must demonstrate consent, ensuring that users can easily understand and control how their data is used.

## Exemptions
Denmark's legislation provides exemptions to the consent requirement for certain categories of cookies, under specific circumstances:

- **Technical Necessity**: Cookies that are strictly necessary for the operation of a website or the provision of a service expressly requested by the user do not require consent.
- **User-Requested Service Provision**: Cookies used to fulfill user requests, such as session management and authentication cookies, are typically exempt.
- **Analytics**: Certain analytical cookies can be exempt if they ensure user privacy through measures such as anonymization, limiting data collection to purposes such as performance measurement while preventing cross-site tracking or third-party access.

These exemptions aim to balance user privacy rights with the need for websites to function effectively.
