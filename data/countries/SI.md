Slovenia has incorporated cookie regulation into its national law through the **Zakon o elektronskih komunikacijah (ZEKom-1)**. This legislation, which is overseen by the **Informacijski pooblaščenec** (Information Commissioner), mandates explicit consent for nearly all cookies, with only a few exceptions for those strictly required for service functionality. Analytics cookies need consent unless they are anonymized to a degree that qualifies them for an exemption.

**Approach in ZEKom-1**:
The key approach in Slovenian law is centered on protecting user privacy by requiring explicit consent for cookies. This aligns with a strict interpretation of consent requirements to ensure user autonomy over their data.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement
In Slovenia, the requirement for consent is explicit, meaning that users must actively agree to the use of cookies, barring certain exceptions. Key aspects of the consent provided for in Slovenian guidelines include:

- **Explicit Consent**: Users must give their clear and deliberate consent for cookies to be stored, except in cases where they are strictly necessary.
- **Informed Decision**: Users must be fully informed about the use and purpose of cookies before consent is requested.
- **Anonymization and Exemption**: Analytic cookies can be exempt from consent requirements if they are sufficiently anonymized to ensure privacy protection.

## Exemptions
The Slovenian framework provides specific exemptions to the requirement to collect consent, which are focused on preserving essential site functionalities without intruding on user privacy:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: These cookies are essential for the basic functions of a website, such as facilitating user navigation or performing authentication tasks.
- **Functionality Cookies**: Essential for the provision of services explicitly requested by the user, these cookies do not require consent because they directly support critical functionalities.
- **Anonymized Analytics Cookies**: These may be exempted when anonymization standards are met, preventing any potential compromise of user privacy through data aggregation or sharing.

These exemptions are carefully tailored to ensure that any impact on user privacy is minimal while maintaining necessary functionality of electronic services.
