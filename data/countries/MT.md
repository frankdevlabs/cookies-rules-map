Malta has integrated the requirements of the ePrivacy Directive into its national framework through the **Data Protection Act**, which includes provisions drawn from the Directive. This legislation is overseen by the **Office of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC)**, Malta's authority dedicated to data protection matters. The law stipulates that prior consent is required for most cookies, including analytical cookies, except those strictly necessary for services explicitly requested by the user. Transparency and thorough user information are compulsory.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement
Under the IDPC’s guidelines, consent must be obtained for all cookies unless they are essential for the operation of the service requested by the user. The criteria for consent are as follows:
- **Informed**: Users should receive clear and comprehensive details about the purpose and use of cookies.
- **Freely Given**: Consent must be acquired before any cookies are stored or used. It cannot be derived from ambiguous actions by the user.
- **Explicit and Revocable**: Consent must be explicit and can be retracted as easily as it was given.

## Exemptions
In line with the widely adopted practices, Malta’s approach allows specific exemptions to the consent requirements for certain categories of cookies. These include:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: Essential cookies required to offer essential functions or services explicitly requested by the user, such as session identifiers.
- **Functional Cookies**: Used to enhance user experience, like maintaining language preferences or supporting basic functionalities needed to provide the services requested by the user.

These exemptions are designed to ensure that mandatory functionalities can operate without unnecessary barriers, while still upholding strong privacy protections for users.
