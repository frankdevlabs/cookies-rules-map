Lithuania has implemented its regulations around cookies under the **Law on Electronic Communications**. This law, enforced by the **State Data Protection Inspectorate (SDPI)**, requires prior consent for analytical cookies while providing specific exemptions for cookies necessary to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the user. Transparency and the provision of clear information are also mandated.

**Key Legal Provision**:
Prior consent is mandatory for the use of analytical cookies. To comply with this:
- Users must be informed clearly about the use and purpose of cookies.
- Consent must be obtained before the cookies are stored on a userâ€™s device.
- Certain exemptions apply to cookies that are essential for providing requested services, aligning with the legal framework for necessary cookies.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement
According to the Lithuanian regulations, consent is needed for all non-essential cookies, while mandatory cookies are exempt from this requirement. The consent must be:
- **Informed**: Users should be provided with clear, concise information regarding the cookie's purpose.
- **Freely Given**: Consent cannot be assumed or implied and should be collected explicitly.
- **Transparent**: The process of obtaining consent should be transparent to users, allowing them to make an informed decision.

This ensures users have control over their data and can withdraw consent at any time.

## Exemptions
Lithuania's legislation provides explicit exemptions for cookies that are necessary for the delivery of information society services expressly requested by the user. These exemptions typically apply to:

- **Essential Cookies**: Required for fundamental website functionalities, including session management.
- **Authentication Cookies**: Allow users to maintain a logged-in state securely.
- Necessary cookies used solely for providing a requested service are not subject to the prior consent requirement.

These exemptions are strictly limited to avoid undue impact on user privacy or user experience.
