Ireland has implemented Article 5.3 of the ePrivacy Directive through the **European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011**. This legislation is enforced by the **Data Protection Commission (DPC)**, Ireland's supervisory authority for data protection. The regulations stipulate that prior consent is required for most cookies and similar tracking technologies, except for those that are strictly necessary or used solely for transmission.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement
The DPC underscores that consent for analytical cookies must be explicit and cannot be implied through user actions, such as continuing to browse a website. Consent must comply with the following guidelines:

- **Explicit Consent Required**: Implied consent is insufficient under these regulations. Users must actively indicate their agreement.
- **Informed and Freely Given**: Users should be fully informed of cookie usage and have the freedom to consent or deny without detriment.
- **Revocable**: Users must be able to withdraw their consent easily at any time.

The DPCâ€™s position is to ensure that consent mechanisms provide users with control over their personal data and privacy.

## Exemptions
Ireland allows certain exemptions from the consent requirement for specific types of cookies, mainly focusing on those necessary for basic website functionality:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: These include cookies essential for the operation of the website or service requested by the user. They are used to enable basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website.
- **Transmission Cookies**: Cookies solely used to carry out the transmission of communications over an electronic communications network.

These exemptions exist to minimize disruption in user experience while ensuring compliance with privacy standards.
