Portugal has incorporated cookie consent requirements into national legislation through **Law No. 41/2004 as amended by Law No. 46/2012**. This law, aligned with the EU's ePrivacy Directive and GDPR, is overseen by the **Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados (CNPD)**, Portugal’s Data Protection Authority. The legislation mandates prior consent for all non-essential cookies, including analytical cookies, unless data is fully anonymized or cookies are necessary for service provision.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement
The CNPD aligns with EU guidelines, highlighting that informed consent is essential except for narrowly defined exemptions. Key aspects of consent are:

- **Informed**: Users must be provided with clear, comprehensive information about cookie purposes and usage.
- **Freely Given**: Consent should be actively and intentionally provided by users, not assumed through mere interaction with the website.
- **Specific and Unambiguous**: Consent must be explicit, ensuring that users can revoke it as easily as it was given initially.

## Exemptions
Portugal’s approach allows for certain exemptions to the consent requirement for cookies:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: Essential to enable basic services or features requested by users, such as network management or access to secured areas.
- **Functionality Cookies**: Used to provide services that users have requested, such as remembering preferences.
- **Performance or Analytical Cookies**: Require consent unless they are anonymized for statistical purposes, serving solely to gather aggregated data.

These exemptions are crafted to ensure that user privacy is respected while allowing essential cookie functionalities without explicit consent.
