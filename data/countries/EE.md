Estonia has implemented a framework for cookie regulation in line with the ePrivacy Directive through its national legislation, the **Electronic Communications Act**. The act mandates that user consent is necessary for most cookies and similar tracking technologies, with specific exceptions for cookies that are essential for communication transmission or services explicitly requested by the user. The enforcement of these regulations is overseen by the **Data Protection Inspectorate (DPI)**.

## Consent Requirement
Under Estonian law, the approach to managing cookies emphasizes the necessity of obtaining prior consent for analytics cookies and other non-essential tracking technologies. According to the legislation:

- **Informed Consent**: Users must be provided with clear and comprehensive information regarding the purpose of the cookies.
- **Consent Conditions**: Consent must be obtained before deploying non-essential cookies unless they fall under specific exemptions.
- **Revocability and Control**: Users should be able to easily withdraw consent or manage their cookie preferences.

### Exemptions
The legislation outlines exemptions to the consent requirement for cookies that meet specific conditions:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: Cookies required for essential communication or to deliver services specifically requested by the user are exempt from needing consent.

These exemptions allow essential cookies to function without compromising user consent needs for non-essential cookies.

## Authority and Enforcement
The **Data Protection Inspectorate (DPI)**, Estonia's data protection authority, is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Electronic Communications Act. The DPI provides guidelines and recommendations on best practices for managing cookies in compliance with the law.

## Guidance on Enforcement and Best Practices
The DPI may issue further guidance on how to comply with the regulations effectively, offering best practices for obtaining consent, informing users, and managing cookies responsibly.
