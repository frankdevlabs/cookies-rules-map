Norway has implemented its cookie usage regulations through the **Norwegian Electronic Communications Act (Ekomloven), Section 2-7b**. This legislation, enforced by the **Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet)**, requires strict consent requirements for the usage of cookies, emphasizing transparency and user control. The law mandates that consent is necessary for placing analytical cookies unless they are anonymized and strictly essential for the service's operation, with the scope of exemptions being notably narrow.

**Key Provisions**:
- **Consent Requirement**: The law stipulates that informed consent is mandatory for placing analytical and tracking cookies on a user's device. The consent must be freely given, specific, and gathered before any cookies are activated.
- **Transparency**: Users must be provided with clear and comprehensive information regarding the use of cookies and the purpose of data collection.
- **User Control**: Individuals must have an accessible way to manage or withdraw consent for cookies at any time.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement

According to the guidance provided by Datatilsynet, consent requirements for cookies in Norway focus on ensuring user privacy is prioritized. Analytical cookies typically require explicit consent unless certain conditions apply:
- **Anonymization**: If cookies are used strictly for anonymized analytics purposes and are necessary for the performance of a service, an exemption may apply.
- **Strict Necessity**: Cookies that are strictly necessary for enabling a service requested by the user can be exempt from the requirement of obtaining prior consent.

The guidance emphasizes that consent should not be bundled with terms and must be presented to users in a clear and straightforward manner. Users also have the right to withdraw consent as easily as they give it.

## Exemptions

The narrow exemptions for consent requirements include cookies that are:
- **Essential for Service Operation**: Necessary cookies for carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network.
- **Strictly Necessary**: Critical for providing an online service at the express request of the user, such as authentication cookies that ensure secure login.
