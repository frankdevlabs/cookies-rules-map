Latviaâ€™s approach to cookie consent and data protection is governed by the **Electronic Communications Law**. This national legislation aligns with the GDPR and is enforced by the **Data State Inspectorate (Datu valsts inspekcija - DVI)**, Latvia's Data Protection Authority. The law mandates that prior consent is required for the use of analytical cookies unless they are strictly necessary for the provisioning of a service expressly requested by the user.

## Approach to Cookie Consent
In Latvia, obtaining user consent is necessary for analytical cookies, adhering to the principle that user privacy should be protected unless cookies are deemed strictly necessary. Key aspects of the consent requirement include:

- **Prior Consent**: Analytical cookies require explicit, informed consent prior to being placed or used unless they are essential for service delivery.
- **Consideration of Necessity**: An examination is required to determine if functional cookies meet the threshold of being 'strictly necessary' for the service.

This framework emphasizes the protection of user privacy while acknowledging the necessity for certain cookies under specific circumstances.

## Guidance on Cookie Use
The guidance for the use and consent of cookies includes considerations for:

- **Functional Cookies**: These may require an assessment under the necessity interpretation to determine if consent can be avoided.
- **Strict Necessity**: Cookies deemed essential for the delivery of services directly requested by the user are exempt from needing prior consent.
