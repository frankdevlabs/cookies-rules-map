Croatia has aligned its legislation with the ePrivacy Directive through the **Electronic Communications Act** and the **Data Protection Act**. The enforcement of these laws is overseen by the **Agencija za zaštitu osobnih podataka (AZOP)**, which is Croatia's Data Protection Authority. This legal framework mandates prior consent for the use of analytical cookies, ensuring protection of user privacy by providing transparency and control to users.

## Guidance on Analytical Cookies
In Croatia, the use of analytical cookies requires obtaining prior user consent. However, privacy concerns can be partially mitigated by anonymizing IP addresses and ensuring that analytical data is not shared further with third parties. Key recommendations for compliance include:

- **Transparent Information**: Users should be clearly informed about the purpose and use of analytical cookies.
- **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Users must have the ability to opt-out from the data collection process.
- **Anonymization**: Implementing IP anonymization can reduce privacy risks.
- **Limited Data Sharing**: Restrict the sharing of analytical data with external parties.

These measures ensure that user data is treated with care, aligning with privacy protection goals.
