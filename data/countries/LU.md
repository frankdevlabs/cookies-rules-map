Luxembourg has incorporated the requirements of the ePrivacy Directive into its national legislation through the **Amended Law of 30 May 2005 on specific provisions regarding privacy in electronic communications**. This law aligns with the GDPR to ensure the protection of personal data in the context of electronic communications. The enforcement of this legislation is under the aegis of the **Commission Nationale pour la Protection des Données (CNPD)**, Luxembourg's Data Protection Authority. The law mandates obtaining prior consent for the use of analytical cookies unless these cookies are deemed strictly necessary for providing a service explicitly requested by the user.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement
According to the CNPD's guidance, obtaining consent is essential for all cookies that are not strictly necessary for electronic communication or service provision. The criteria for consent include:

- **Prior Consent**: Users must give consent before any non-essential cookie is stored or accessed on their devices.
- **Informed Consent**: Users should be provided with clear information about the purpose of the cookies used.
- **Specific and Explicit Consent**: Consent must be explicitly obtained and should cover specific cookie functions.
- **Revocable Consent**: Users should have an easy method to withdraw their consent at any time.

## Exemptions
Luxembourg’s legal framework provides exemptions for certain types of cookies from the consent requirement, aimed at minimizing the impact on user privacy:

- **Technical Cookies Necessary for Electronic Communications**: These cookies facilitate the operation and provision of electronic communication services.
- **Cookies Strictly Necessary for User-Requested Services**: If a cookie is essential for a service explicitly requested by the user, such as session management or load balancing, it may be exempt from prior consent requirements.
