Romania has aligned with data protection standards by enacting **Law No. 506/2004** concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. This legislation is enforced by the **Autoritatea Națională de Supraveghere a Prelucrării Datelor cu Caracter Personal (ANSPDCP)**, Romania's Data Protection Authority. Under this law, Romania requires prior consent for analytical cookies and emphasizes that valid consent must be active and informed. The approach taken by Romanian law does not provide blanket exemptions for analytics or audience measurement cookies, as these are not deemed strictly necessary.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement
The Romanian approach to consent emphasizes the following principles:
- **Active User Action**: Consent must be obtained through explicit user action, meaning passive acceptance like continued browsing does not constitute consent.
- **Informed Consent**: Users should be fully informed about the types of data being collected and the purposes for which it is used before consenting.
- **Specificity**: Each type of data processing requires a distinct consent, prohibiting the bundling of consent for multiple purposes.
- **Revocability**: Users should have the ability to withdraw consent as easily as they give it.

These requirements underscore the importance of ensuring user autonomy and privacy in the digital landscape, with stringent guidelines to safeguard against unauthorized data use.

## Exemptions
In Romania, the legislation does not provide an exemption for analytics or audience measurement cookies on the grounds that these are not strictly necessary. The focus remains firmly on obtaining prior, explicit consent for any non-essential cookies, ensuring adherence to high privacy standards.
