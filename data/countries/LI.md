Liechtenstein has incorporated the ePrivacy Directive into national legislation through the **Telecommunications Act** and the **Data Protection Act**, which align with the requirements of the directive. The enforcement and oversight are carried out by the **Datenschutzstelle (DSS)**, Liechtenstein's Data Protection Authority. Compliance with these laws requires consent for most cookies, placing emphasis on the rule of necessity and proportionality in data collection processes.

## Consent for Cookies
Under Liechtenstein's legal framework, consent is generally required for analytical cookies unless they are deemed strictly necessary for the service requested by the user. This means that:

- **Necessity**: Cookies considered essential for providing a service explicitly requested by the user may be exempt from consent.
- **Proportionality**: The data collection must be appropriate in relation to the purpose for which it is collected.

## Authority and Responsibilities
The **Datenschutzstelle (DSS)** is the principal authority responsible for the enforcement of data protection and privacy laws in Liechtenstein. The DSS provides guidance to ensure that data controllers understand their obligations regarding data collection, storage, and user consent.

## Guidelines and Best Practices
The DSS emphasizes a stringent approach to data protection:

- **Informed Consent**: Users need to be clearly informed about how and why their data is collected and used.
- **Freely Given**: Users should genuinely have a choice and cannot be coerced into giving consent.
- **Proportional Data Use**: Data collected should be proportionate to the purposes and not excessive. 

The DSS encourages organizations to adopt transparent practices and ensure that users can easily opt in or out of cookie use.

## Exemptions
Although Liechtenstein's approach generally requires consent, exemptions can be applied when:

- The cookie usage is strictly necessary for the delivery of an online service explicitly requested by the user.

This ensures that user privacy is protected while allowing necessary operations without explicit consent.
