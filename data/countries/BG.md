Bulgaria has implemented the ePrivacy Directive in its national legislation through the **Electronic Communications Act**, which is enforced by the **Commission for Personal Data Protection (CPDP)**. This legislation mandates that prior consent is required for analytics cookies as they are generally not considered strictly necessary. However, there are specific exemptions for cookies that are vital to service delivery, underlining the need for transparency and clear user information.

## Approach to Cookie Consent
In Bulgaria, the law requires that prior consent is obtained for cookies that collect analytics data, with an emphasis on ensuring users are well-informed about the data being collected and its purpose. The key aspects include:

- **Transparency**: Users must be clearly and comprehensively informed about the cookies in use and their purposes.
- **Consent Requirement**: Prior explicit consent is essential for non-essential cookies, which are generally used for tracking and analytics purposes.
- **Exemptions for Necessary Cookies**: Cookies that are strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of a service requested by the user do not require prior consent.

## Exemptions
The Electronic Communications Act aligns with the ePrivacy Directive by allowing certain cookies to be exempt from the consent requirement. These exemptions typically include:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: Essential for the functioning of the website or service, enabling basic functions such as page navigation and access to secure areas.
  
This approach aims to balance user privacy with the functional needs of websites and services, ensuring that only vital cookies are used without explicit consent.

**Color Code**: **Red** - Prior consent is required for analytics cookies; exemptions apply only to strictly necessary cookies.
