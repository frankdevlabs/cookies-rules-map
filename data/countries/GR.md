Greece implements cookie regulations through **Law 3471/2006** and **Law 4624/2019**, aligning with the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR requirements. These laws are enforced by the **Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA)**. Consent is necessary for analytics cookies and similar tracking technologies to protect user privacy. Essential cookies, crucial for website operations, are exempt from these requirements.

**Overview of Greek Cookie Legislation**:
Greece's data protection laws emphasize the importance of obtaining prior consent before storing or retrieving information on a user's device, except for cookies necessary for basic website functionality. Here's a brief look into these requirements:

### Key Requirements:
- **Prior Consent**: Users must give explicit consent before analytics cookies are placed.
- **Transparency**: Clear and comprehensive information about the purpose and usage of cookies must be provided.
- **User Information**: Users should be informed about how their data will be used and any means available to oppose the action.
- **Essential Cookies Exemption**: Cookies essential to the operation of the site, such as those for user login or security purposes, are exempt from consent requirements.

## Guidance on Consent Requirement
The HDPA provides detailed guidelines on consent, stressing that it must be:

- **Informed**: Users are thoroughly informed about the purpose of data collection and the use of cookies.
- **Freely Given**: Consent cannot be implied through general use of the service and needs to be collected prior to the storage of cookies.
- **Specific and Unambiguous**: Consent must be clear-cut and users should be able to easily withdraw it at any time.

## Exemptions
Greek legislation recognizes certain exemptions from the consent requirement for necessary cookies, without which the service wouldn't function efficiently:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: These facilitate critical operations like navigating between pages.
- **Authentication Cookies**: Essential for maintaining user login states across sessions.
- **Customization Cookies**: Enable users to specify preferences such as language settings.
